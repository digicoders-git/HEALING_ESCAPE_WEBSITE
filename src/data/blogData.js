      India has emerged as a premier destination for medical tourism due to its unique combination of clinical excellence and cost-effectiveness. 
      
      The primary reasons include world-class hospitals equipped with the latest technology, highly experienced surgeons trained internationally, and the use of FDA-approved medical devices. 
      Furthermore, the medical staff is predominantly English-speaking, which removes communication barriers for international patients. 
      From heart surgeries to organ transplants, India offers treatments that meet global standards but at 60-80% lower costs than the West.

      When choosing a hospital, the first thing to check is accreditation—NABH (National) and JCI (International) are benchmarks of safety. 
      Next, look for the hospital's success rates in your specific treatment. A hospital might be great for Cardiology but average for Oncology. 
      Check the infrastructure, the availability of 24/7 emergency care, and specifically their dedicated international patient desk. 
      Proximity to the airport and availability of guesthouses nearby are also practical factors to consider.

      Once decided, you apply for a Medical Visa (e-Medical Visa for most countries). 
      Upon arrival, our team assists you with hospital registration. After the procedure, the recovery phase begins, 
      where follow-up consultations ensure the treatment's success. Finally, you receive a 'Fit to Fly' certificate to return home.

    introduction: "Transparency in medical costs is essential for international patients. India offers world-class care at a fraction of the cost, but understanding the variables is key to planning.",
    content: `
      Medical costs in India are generally all-inclusive packages. They cover the surgeon's fee, hospital stay, implants, medicines, and consumables. 
      However, factors like room category (Single, Deluxe, Suite), patient's co-morbidities, and length of stay can impact the final bill. 
      At Healing Escape, we provide transparent cost estimates before you travel so there are no surprises.
